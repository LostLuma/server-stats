# Server Stats

Implementation of server-side statistics for legacy versions of Minecraft.

## Information

Allows recording player statistics on legacy servers using the modern statistics system.  
This is intended to be used by players planning to eventually upgrade to 1.7.x or later.

As Minecraft discards all player statistics when upgrading to 1.8 and later Server Stats
also includes a statistics upgrade system for players in Minecraft 1.8.9 through 1.12.2.

To accurately view player statistics you will either need to install Server Stats on the
client or upgrade your world to 1.7.x (or beyond!) to see them using the vanilla client.

## Installation

Server Stats runs on [Quilt Loader](https://quiltmc.org/en/) using [OrnitheMC Tooling](https://ornithemc.net/) to run on legacy Minecraft versions.  
A release version of the mod is available for each Minecraft version from 1.0.0 to 1.6.4 on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-stats) and [GitHub](https://github.com/LostLuma/server-stats/releases).
