# Server Stats

Implementation of server-side statistics for legacy versions of Minecraft.

## Information

Allows recording player statistics on legacy servers using the modern statistics system.  
This is intended to be used by players planning to eventually upgrade to 1.7.x or later.

There is currently no way to view your statistics except to upgrade your world to 1.7.x.  
I will upgrade this mod for other in-between versions (1.4.7, 1.5.2, 1.6.4) when I get to them in my playthrough.

## Installation

Server Stats runs on [Quilt Loader](https://quiltmc.org/en/) using [OrnitheMC Tooling](https://ornithemc.net/) to run on legacy Minecraft versions.  
Currently there is no proper releases of this mod, if you'd like to use it clone the repo and run `./gradlew build` to get a jar.
